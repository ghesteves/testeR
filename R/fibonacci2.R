#' Applies and prints the golden ratio to each index(n by n-1) of a Fibonacci sequence

#' This function print a Fibonacci sequence and a sequence of ratio between the n-th and index n-1
#' according with the second argument that's determinate how many decimals places be needed to get the

#' This function show too how many ratios has been calculated for get a
