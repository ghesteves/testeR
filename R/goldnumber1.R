#' Applies and prints the golden ratio to each index(n by n-1) of a Fibonacci sequence
#'
#' This function print a Fibonacci sequence and a sequence of ratio between the n-th and index n-1
#' according with the second argument that's determinate how many decimals places be needed to get the
#' rounded gold number.
#' This function show too how many ratios has been calculated for get a
#' approximation of the gold number with 3 decimals places.
#'
#' This is just an initial test for constructing R packages using git and
#' GitHub on-line.
#'
#' @param a is a positive integer number, the argument used for generate a Fibonacci sequence.
#'
#' @param b also a positive integer number, the argument used for determinate how many decimal
#'           places needed for approximation.
#'
#' @return two vectors with the Fibonacci sequence and the gold ratio between n-th and the index n-1.
